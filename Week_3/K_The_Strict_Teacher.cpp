// Narek and Tsovak were busy preparing this round, so they have not managed to do their homework and decided to steal David's homework. Their strict teacher noticed that David has no homework and now wants to punish him. She hires other teacher to help her catch David. And now m teacher together are chasing him. Luckily, the classroom is big, so David has many places to hide.

//The classroom can be represented as a one-dimensional line with cells from 1 to n inclusive.
// At the start, all m teachers and David are in distinct cells. Then they make moves. During each move
//  . David goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one.
//  . Then ,each of the m teacher simultaneously goes to an adjacent cell or stays at the current one

// This continues until David is caught. David is caught if any of the teachers (possibly more than one) is located in the same cell as David. Everyone sees othe's moves, so they all act optimally.

// Acting optimally means the students makes his moves in a way that maximizes the number of moves the teachers need to catch him
