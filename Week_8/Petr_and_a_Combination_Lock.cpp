//  The best way to check the condition in the statement is to use bitmasks. Iterate from 0 to 2^n - 1 and for each number consider its binary representation. If the i-th bit of representation is set to 0. then decide to perform the i-th rotation clockwise. In the opposite case, do it counter clockwise. Finally, check if the whole angle is a multiple of 360 and if so, output  "YES". If no good combination of rotations was found. output "NO".
